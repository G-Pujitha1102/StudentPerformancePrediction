# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction 📊

This project analyzes and predicts student performance using R. It uses the *Students Performance Dataset* to explore various factors influencing student scores, visualize trends, build predictive models, and identify students who may need help.

---

## 📁 Files

- StudentPerformance.csv — Dataset from Kaggle.
- StudentPerformance.R — Complete R script for data analysis and modeling.
- README.md — Project documentation.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Load and preprocess the dataset.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Visualize patterns and insights across gender, parental education, and preparation.
- Build a Linear Regression model to predict math scores.
- Classify students into performance categories.
- Identify underperforming students and those who may need help.
- Plot actual vs predicted scores and analyze residuals.

## 📌 Technologies Used

- *Language:* R
- *Libraries Used:*
  - ggplot2
  - dplyr
  - readr
  - tidyverse
