# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction 📊

This project analyzes and predicts student performance using R. It uses the *Students Performance Dataset* to explore various factors influencing student scores, visualize trends, build predictive models, and identify students who may need help.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To predict students' math scores using attributes like gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of            education, lunch type, and test preparation course and also to identify those who are under performance and need help.


## 📁 Files

- StudentsPerformance.csv — Dataset from Kaggle.
- modeling.R — Complete R script for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
- README.md — Project documentation.

## 🧪 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Converted categorical variables to factors.
   - Checked for missing values.
   - Split data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Building**
   - Built three models: 
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Used RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
   - R² (R-squared) value

4. **Visualization**
   - Bar chart comparison of model performances.

- Identify underperforming students and those who may need help.
- Plot actual vs predicted scores and analyze residuals.

## 📊 Model Performance Comparison

| Model            | RMSE   | R-squared |
|------------------|--------|-----------|
| Linear Regression| 5.88   | 0.87      |
| Decision Tree     | 7.78   | 0.74      |
| Random Forest     | 6.46   | 0.82      |

🎉 **Linear Regression** performed the best based on both RMSE and R².


 ## 📊 Bar Chart Comparison
A bar chart was created using `ggplot2` to visually compare the RMSE and R² values for each model.
